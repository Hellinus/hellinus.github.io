# "Real-World" City Levels
In this independent study project, I will focus on the design principles of “real-world” city levels, including how to translate real urban structures into playable game spaces, how to guide player exploration within complex city layouts, and how to balance realism with gameplay needs.

> Level example: [Los Santos](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_(HD_Universe)) in [Grand Theft Auto V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/), based on [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and its greater metropolitan area.

# Target Games
Due to the rapid development of game design in the past few years, modern games will be my first choice.

- [Grand Theft Auto V](https://store.steampowered.com/app/3240220/Grand_Theft_Auto_V_Enhanced/): [Los Santos](https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Los_Santos_(HD_Universe)), based on [Los Angeles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Los_Angeles), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California) and its greater metropolitan area.
- [Marvel's Spider-Man 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2651280/Marvels_SpiderMan_2/): [New York City](https://marvels-spider-man.fandom.com/wiki/New_York_City), based on [New York City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_City), [New York State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_York_(state)).
- [Watch_Dogs® 2](https://store.steampowered.com/app/447040/Watch_Dogs_2/): [San Francisco](https://watchdogs.fandom.com/wiki/San_Francisco), based on [San Francisco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco), [California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/California).

Other games will also be referenced as supporting examples, such as [Cyberpunk 2077](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1091500/Cyberpunk_2077/) and [Fallout: New Vegas](https://store.steampowered.com/app/22380/Fallout_New_Vegas/), among others.

# Analysis Framework & Research Focus

1. **City Structure & Spatial Abstraction:** How real-world city elements (paths, edges, districts, nodes, landmarks) are simplified, exaggerated, or reorganized to support gameplay flow and player comprehension.
2. **Scale, Density, and Traversal:** How city scale and density are adjusted to balance realism with traversal speed, traversal mechanics, and moment-to-moment engagement.
3. **Exploration Flow & Player Guidance:** How level designers guide player movement and exploration in dense urban environments through landmark placement, sightlines, road hierarchy, vertical traversal routes, and environmental cues, while maintaining a sense of player freedom.

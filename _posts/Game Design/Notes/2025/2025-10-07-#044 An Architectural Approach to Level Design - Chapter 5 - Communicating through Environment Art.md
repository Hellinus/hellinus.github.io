Game levels utilize sensory information (visual and auditory) to connect with players.

- Different teaching methods present in modern games
- How to utilize art assets in such a way that the player associates them with meaningful information, and how they can be organized to teach players through direct or indirect methods
- How to use visual information to turn game levels into spaces of information that create feelings of certainty and uncertainty in players

## TEACHING THEORIES FOR GAME LEVELS
This chapter will reinforce three models of teaching commonly considered by game designers - the operant conditioning model, the Montessori method, and constructivism - as the framework of our visual communication methodology.

### Behavior Theory and Operant Conditioning
**Classical conditioning:** Pavlov would ring a bell before feeding his dogs, thereby causing them to salivate every time he rang a bell.

**Operant conditioning** involves changing voluntary actions of subjects via positive and negative reinforcements, as well as punishments.

> Skinner box

Skinner himself argued for a methodology that avoided emphasis on lectures or tutorials, but rather on breaking large tasks into a series of smaller ones. As each task is performed, correct actions are reinforced so the student learns the proper way of performing his or her tasks.

> tutorials for games

The Skinner box model can be used to describe the repetition of one singular action over and over again.

> As such, it has been used as a derogatory term for games in the mobile free-to-play market that require players to wait extended periods of time to do simple actions.

### Montessori Method
> The world didn’t want him to fail here. It was pushing him, but gently.
> — *THOMAS WAS ALONE*, MIKE BITHELL

Game design is a second-order design problem, meaning that designers are communicating with players indirectly through their games.

Montessori views of games support the development of player skill and problem solving over the course of an entire game. In a game’s early puzzles, players learn the extent of their avatar’s movement capabilities before these capabilities are tested in later, more complex, puzzles.

This method of player-learning can focus early levels on teaching players how to deal with obstacles individually, and then mix and match them later to create more complex puzzles.

> This is especially useful if designers have created a set of modular gameplay assets that they can simply mix and match within their game engine environments.

This outlook on teaching in games differs from the operant conditioning model in that it does not directly address reinforcements or punishments as outcomes to solving in-game situations.

> The skill gates discussed in Chapter 2, where players cannot progress until they learn the ability that lets them overcome a particular obstacle, are examples of this kind of teaching. Skill gates are self-reinforcing, as players are simply stuck if, for example, they do not learn that jumping is a way to pass over a block that is in their way.

### Constructivism
Concrete experience, observation and reflection, forming abstract concepts, and testing in new situations

In Game: attempting to overcome an obstacle, observation and reflection of play outcome, forming strategies, and testing new strategies.

For designers:
- create interactive environments and challenges for players to experiment with
- set up rewards to reinforce mechanics
- provide non-severe punishments, players should be only set back to a point where they can comfortably retry a challenge

- **Operant conditioning**: reinforce gameplay mechanics through applications of rewards and other positive game outcomes for success and through punishments for failures.
- **The Montessori Method**: a framework for understanding how to structure a series of puzzles or challenges over the course of a game so that players can deduce solutions by recognizing elements of previous challenges, even if they are used in new ways.
- **Constructivist methods**: structure challenges, feedback, and punishments in such a way that players are motivated to iterate their play to overcome or master gameplay challenges.
